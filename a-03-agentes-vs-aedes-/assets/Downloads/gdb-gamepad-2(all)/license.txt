I needed to make buttons for UI and prompts for current and future projects. Here is that pack. So go ahead and use it in your game and software projects.

You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.

Most buttons fit within a 16x16 space.

Palette: Rosy-42

Pack includes buttons/joysticks for:

Playstation
Xbox
Switch
Some alternative buttons
Smaller buttons for the main buttons
Keyboard and Mouse
Will update as I update it myself. This includes any new gamepads/platforms such as Mobile.
